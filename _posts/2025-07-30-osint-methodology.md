Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting and analyzing publicly available information to produce actionable intelligence. This guide provides a structured methodology for conducting OSINT investigations.

## OSINT Investigation Framework

### 1. Planning and Requirements

Before starting any OSINT investigation:

- Define clear objectives and scope
- Identify target entities (persons, organizations, domains)
- Establish legal and ethical boundaries
- Plan data collection and storage methods

### 2. Collection Phase

#### People Intelligence (HUMINT)

**Social Media Platforms:**
- Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram
- Professional networks and forums
- Dating sites and personal blogs

**Public Records:**
- Electoral rolls and voter registrations
- Court records and legal documents
- Property records and business registrations

#### Technical Intelligence (TECHINT)

**Domain and IP Intelligence:**
```bash
# Whois information
whois domain.com

# DNS enumeration
dig domain.com ANY
nslookup domain.com

# Subdomain discovery
amass enum -d domain.com
subfinder -d domain.com
```

**Network Analysis:**
```bash
# Shodan searches
shodan search "org:Company Name"
shodan host 192.168.1.1

# Certificate transparency
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.domain.com&output=json"
```

### 3. Essential OSINT Tools

#### Search Engines
- Google with advanced operators
- Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex
- Specialized search engines (Pipl, TinEye)

#### Social Media Intelligence
- Sherlock - Username enumeration
- Social Mapper - Social media correlation
- Twint - Twitter intelligence

#### Domain and Network Tools
- Maltego - Link analysis
- Recon-ng - Web reconnaissance framework
- TheHarvester - Email and subdomain gathering

### 4. Advanced Techniques

#### Google Dorking
```

intitle:"confidential" site:company.com
inurl:admin site:company.com
cache:company.com
```

#### Social Engineering Preparation
- Company organizational charts
- Employee contact information
- Business relationships and partnerships
- Technology stack identification

### 5. Analysis and Correlation

- Cross-reference information from multiple sources
- Identify patterns and connections
- Verify information authenticity
- Timeline creation and gap analysis

### 6. Reporting and Documentation

- Maintain detailed source attribution
- Create visual relationship maps
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Ensure data protection and privacy

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Always ensure your OSINT activities comply with:
- Local and international laws
- Terms of service of platforms
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Professional ethical standards

Remember: Just because information is publicly available doesn't mean it's legal or ethical to collect and use it in all contexts.
