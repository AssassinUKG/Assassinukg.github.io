Welcome to the my GitHub page!

My name is AssassinUKG, and I am a cyber security professional with over 10 years of experience in the field. I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and incident response, and have worked with a variety of organizations to secure their networks and protect their sensitive data.

On this GitHub page, you will find a collection of tools and scripts that I have developed to assist with my work. These include custom exploits, reconnaissance scripts, and other utilities that can be used to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your cyber security operations.

In addition to the tools on this page, I also maintain a blog here where I share my thoughts and experiences on the latest developments in the cyber security industry. I hope that you will find these resources useful, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and expertise with you.
